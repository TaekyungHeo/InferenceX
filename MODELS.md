# Models

English | [中文](MODELS_zh.md)

This document tracks every model benchmarked by InferenceX-e2e: when it was added, which benchmark scenarios are currently active for it, and which scenarios are deprecated. Results for active scenarios are published to <https://inferencex.com/>.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | ISL/OSL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Agentic coding | Long Context, Multi Turn Realistic traffic trace replay with sub agents | Active — trace-replay agentic-coding benchmark (see [`benchmarks/agentic/`](benchmarks/agentic/)). Going forward, new models will likely be onboarded with agentic coding only. |
| Single-turn 8k1k | 8192 / 1024 | Active — the primary fixed-sequence-length scenario. |
| Single-turn 1k1k | 1024 / 1024 | **Deprecated for all models** since 2026-07-17 ([#2263](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/2263)), to save GPU cluster time for higher-priority real-world agentic-coding benchmarks and new frontier models. Archived configs live in [`configs/deprecated/`](configs/deprecated/). |
| Single-turn 1k8k | 1024 / 8192 | **Deprecated for all models** since 2026-03-27 ([#911](https://github.com/SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX/pull/911)), to save GPU cluster time for higher-priority real-world agentic-coding benchmarks and new frontier models. Configs were removed, not archived. |

## AgentX Guidelines

### E2E normalized interactivity and Pareto-frontier policy

E2E normalized interactivity is the primary user-side latency metric and default x-axis for AgentX trace-replay results. For every valid profiling request `i`, let `OSL_i` be its positive output sequence length and `E2EL_i` be its positive end-to-end latency, including both time to first token (TTFT) and generation time. First compute the per-request time per delivered output token:

`r_i = E2EL_i / OSL_i` (seconds per output token)

For percentile `q`, E2E normalized interactivity is:

`E2E normalized interactivity_q = 1 / percentile_q({r_i})` (output tokens/s/user)

The dashboard defaults to P90. Taking the percentile in seconds per output token before inverting preserves the slow-tail interpretation while presenting a higher-is-better rate. This is not the ratio of separately aggregated OSL and E2EL percentiles. At the request level, the metric can be understood approximately as:

`OSL / E2EL ≈ 1 / (TPOT + TTFT / OSL)`

Intuitively, it can be thought of as decode interactivity with a penalty for the queueing and prefill time during which the user receives no output tokens.

### Advantages

- It reduces the direct effect of variable AgentX output lengths on raw E2E latency: a request is not treated as slower merely because it correctly generated more output.
- It captures both TTFT and decode cadence in one user-facing delivery rate, discouraging configurations that improve decode-only interactivity while allowing TTFT or total task completion time to regress.
- It provides a higher-is-better optimization target in familiar tokens/s/user units while retaining the complete request path.

### Tradeoffs and limitations

- It is not conventional decode interactivity (`1 / TPOT`), so the absolute values are not directly comparable; E2E normalized interactivity is typically lower because it includes TTFT.
- TTFT is amortized over OSL, so short outputs receive a larger TTFT penalty than long outputs. The metric remains workload-dependent and comparisons require the same trace distribution and benchmark methodology.
- A single combined metric cannot show whether a regression came from TTFT or decode. The separate E2E latency, interactivity, and TTFT views remain diagnostic views.
- The metric requires persisted per-request traces with valid E2EL and OSL values. Runs without those traces cannot participate in the canonical frontier.

### North-star Pareto policy

For every supported y-axis metric and comparison group, the Pareto frontier computed against E2E normalized interactivity is the canonical AgentX **North Star** frontier. All other AgentX x-axis views are gated by that canonical winner set:

- The E2E normalized interactivity view displays the canonical frontier.
- The E2E latency, conventional interactivity, and TTFT views display the intersection of the canonical North Star frontier and the true Pareto frontier in the currently displayed coordinates.

Therefore, a point cannot appear on any AgentX Pareto frontier unless it is both a North Star winner and non-dominated on the selected chart. This prevents a configuration from entering a published frontier by optimizing one secondary latency metric at the expense of end-to-end user experience. Dominated points remain available in the unfiltered scatter view for diagnosis.

### Engine submission policy

Based on feedback from Tier 1 AI labs and the broader ML community about what they want to see in InferenceX AgentX, InferenceX uses an explicit model-to-framework mapping. Labs have reported that proprietary or hardware-specific engines such as TensorRT-LLM and ATOM do not always provide every feature their AgentX workloads require.

The native/upstream engines in the table below are the first-class engines for each model. If a provider supports both the native/upstream vLLM engine and native/upstream SGLang engine as first-class LLM engines, it must first submit the engine or engines assigned by this mapping before submitting additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines such as ATOM, TensorRT-LLM, or TokenSpeed. Multiple additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines may be submitted.

There are two exceptions to this ordering guideline:

1. Brand-new hardware SKUs, such as MI455X UALoE72, VR200 NVL72, Rubin NVL8, TPUv8t, and TPUv8i, may use a hardware-specific engine first for initial support. The corresponding native/upstream vLLM or SGLang submission is expected to follow shortly afterward.
2. For a new model architecture, a provider may use another engine first if it cannot support the mapped native/upstream vLLM or SGLang engine as a first-class engine and can articulate to core maintainers a fundamental, first-principles reason why the mapped framework does not yet support the hardware-model combination.

InferenceX supports the maintainers of both SGLang and vLLM and reflects feedback from AI labs and the ML community that want to see performance from both frameworks. Among models assigned to one primary framework, the mapping splits assignments evenly between vLLM and SGLang; models mapped to both provide shared coverage. This ensures that InferenceX tests both frameworks equally without favoring one over the other.

The table also records both the agreed plan-of-record (PoR) draft-model mapping and proposals that still require partner alignment.

| Model | Primary native/upstream engines | Agreed draft model(s) (PoR) | Proposed draft model(s) pending partner alignment | Additional engines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeepSeek-V4-Pro 1.6T (`dsv4`) | native/upstream vLLM engine and native/upstream SGLang engine | native MTP | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro-DSpark` — proposed for AgentX only under the same synthetic-acceptance methodology; pending partner alignment. Single-turn 8k1k remains on the native MTP heads. | Additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines under the ordering guideline and exceptions above |
| Kimi-K3 (`kimik3`) | native/upstream vLLM engine | `Inferact/Kimi-K3-DSpark` | — | Additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines under the ordering guideline and exceptions above |
| MiniMax-M3 (`minimaxm3`) | native/upstream vLLM engine | `Inferact/MiniMax-M3-EAGLE3` and/or `Inferact/MiniMax-M3-EAGLE3-GQA` | — | Additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines under the ordering guideline and exceptions above |
| GLM-5.2 (`glm5.2`) | native/upstream SGLang engine | native MTP | — | Additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines under the ordering guideline and exceptions above |
| Qwen3.5-397B-A17B (`qwen3.5`) | native/upstream SGLang engine | native MTP | — | Additional non-vLLM/SGLang engines under the ordering guideline and exceptions above |

### KV cache offloading policy

To align with the design principle of shipping quickly by limiting scope, the initial AgentX policy permits only CPU DRAM KV cache offloading, and its use is optional. Supported approaches include the vLLM Connector, LMCache, SGLang HiCache, Mooncake CPU DRAM Connector, Dynamo KVBM, CPU DRAM P2P pooling, and similar CPU-memory mechanisms. Vendors may enable or disable CPU KV cache offloading for each submission at their discretion, including disabling it when that produces better Pareto points.

The amount of CPU DDR5 used for KV cache offloading must be proportional to the fraction of a server's GPUs used by the serving configuration:

`allowed CPU DRAM = per-server baseline CPU DRAM × (GPUs used by the configuration / total GPUs in the server)`

This rule applies independently to each server.

| CPU DRAM capacity class | Example SKUs | Per-server baseline and limit |
|---|---|---|
| No standardized CPU DRAM capacity | HGX B200, HGX B300, MI355X chassis | At most 3 TB per server. A configuration using 4 of 8 GPUs may therefore use at most 1.5 TB of CPU DRAM for KV cache offloading. |
| Standardized CPU DRAM capacity | TPUv7, GB200 NVL72, GB300 NVL72 | The SKU's standard installed CPU DRAM capacity is the baseline, with no additional per-server hard cap. The proportional-GPU rule still applies. |

The 3 TB limit prevents an unrealistic memory-capacity race in which hardware vendors ask CSPs and OEMs to install the maximum number of high-capacity DIMMs, potentially reaching 6 TB per server. Total cost of ownership (TCO) per accelerator chip will be normalized by the cost of the server's total CPU DDR5 capacity.

Other offloading tiers, including NVMe KV cache offloading, are outside the initial scope and may be introduced after the InferenceX v3 release. NVMe KV cache offloading is tentatively targeted as a fast follow-up in InferenceX v3.5 or as part of InferenceX v4.

[^1]: `llama70b` predates the master-config system; its configs were deleted on retirement rather than archived in `configs/deprecated/`. It first shipped as workflow templates in the initial repo import (2025-08-12).

## Notes

- The `Prefix` column is the canonical `model-prefix` used in `configs/*-master.yaml` and by `generate_sweep_configs.py --model-prefix`.
- "Retired" means the model no longer has any active scenario. Retired models' configs (except `llama70b`) are archived under [`configs/deprecated/`](configs/deprecated/).
- `dsr1` began as the DeepSeek-V3 workflow templates in the initial repo import and was switched to DeepSeek-R1 benchmarking on 2025-08-13 (renamed `dsv3` → `dsr1` on 2025-08-20).
